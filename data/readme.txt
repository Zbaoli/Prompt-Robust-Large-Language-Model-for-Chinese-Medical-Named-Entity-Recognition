Due to data sharing restrictions imposed by the CBLUE official platform, we are unable to release their proprietary dataset. 
However, we have made our supplementary materials and processed data publicly available through the following repository: [Baidu Pan link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LSIxfL6KyDENR9Nz-df_1Q (access code: 7gvh)]. 
Researchers can obtain the original CBLUE data directly from the official CBLUE website, and subsequently apply our publicly shared label generation and label type generation algorithms for annotation purposes.
